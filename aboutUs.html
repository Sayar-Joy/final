          Founded in 2025 by a passionate team of Burmese creators based in the
          Asia-Pacific region, Yangon TV aims to bring global cinema closer to
          Myanmar audiences. We specialize in short-form recaps of acclaimed
          international films, making it easier for busy viewers to stay
          connected with world cinema. For those who want the full experience,
          our films are fully subtitled in Burmese, ensuring accessibility and
          enjoyment for all.
          <br />
          As an independent and underground media platform, Yangon TV is
          committed to truth, cultural integrity, and people-first storytelling.
          Currently available via web streaming, we plan to launch a mobile app
          within six months and expand to Smart TV platforms within a
          year—further broadening access to quality content.
